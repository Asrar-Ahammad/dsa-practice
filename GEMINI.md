# SDE Sheet

This project contains a collection of Python scripts with solutions to common software development problems, organized by topic. The goal is to provide a reference for anyone preparing for software development engineering interviews or looking to practice their problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   `01_language_basics`: Contains scripts related to the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language.
-   `02_patterns`: Contains scripts that implement various programming patterns.
-   `03_sorting`: Contains implementations of different sorting algorithms.
-   `04_arrays`: Contains solutions to array-based problems.
-   `05_binary_search`: Contains solutions to problems that can be solved using binary search.
-   `06_string`: Contains solutions to string manipulation problems.
-   `07_linked_list`: Contains implementations of linked list data structures and solutions to related problems.

## How to Run

Each Python script is self-contained and can be run directly from the command line. For example, to run the `pass_by_assignment.py` script, use the following command:

```bash
python 01_language_basics/pass_by_assignment.py
```
